   - Use a web browser to control, please refer to [here](https://github.com/mangdangroboticsclub/mini_pupper_web_controller).

## Installation by self

Before installation, you need to install the BSP(board support package) repo for your [Mini Pupper 2](https://github.com/mangdangroboticsclub/mini_pupper_2_bsp) or [Mini Pupper](https://github.com/mangdangroboticsclub/mini_pupper_bsp.git).

After that, please follow the below steps to install this repo.

```
cd /home/ubuntu/
git clone https://github.com/mangdangroboticsclub/StanfordQuadruped.git
cd StanfordQuadruped
./install.sh
```

configure the network, this will overwrite your current network configuration, enable the wireless network and breate a bridge interface with the IP address of 10.0.0.10/24 as required by UDPComms. This will not work if any of your interfaces is already connected to the 10.0.0.0/24 network. The network configuration becomes active with the next reboot.

```
./configure_network.sh <SSID> <password>
sudo reboot
```
